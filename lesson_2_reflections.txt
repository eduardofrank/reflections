What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository it gets an invisible directory where git stores all of its metadata the enables version control capabilities.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an area you use to organize the files before committing. That is the main difference to working directory and repository and also its biggest value too.
